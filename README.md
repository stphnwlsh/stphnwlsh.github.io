# GitHub Pages Personal Profile

[![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/stphnwlsh/stphnwlsh.github.io/GitHub%20Pages?label=Build%20Pipeline&logo=github&logoColor=white&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/stphnwlsh/stphnwlsh.github.io/actions/workflows/github-pages.yml)

This is a simple personal page built on GitHub pages.  The aim was to put in as little effort as possible while making something fairly custom as a landing page for me.  

I wrote a post about how I created this site on Medium.  [Check it out!](https://medium.com/gitconnected/build-your-personal-brand-with-a-profile-page-using-github-pages-and-hugo-6476de6071d1)

## References

I used a number of freely available tools and templates along the way.

- Hosting - [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)
- Website Framework - [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- Website Theme - [Lynx](https://github.com/jpanther/lynx)
- Publishing - [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
- Publishing Action - [Shohei Ueda's Template](https://github.com/peaceiris)

Minor customisations made along the way via updates to CSS and my own content but that's all.

## Support

I'm sharing some of my work here and if it helps you, I'd love it if you'd consider supporting me.
